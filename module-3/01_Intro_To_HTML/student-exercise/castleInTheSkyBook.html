                    If I get down to it, the true reason I fell in love with this story is because of the characters. Sheeta the innocent heroine with a mysterious crystal necklace, Pazu the unlikely hero with a delightful trumpet and a heart of gold, Muska the suave yet despicable villain with malevolent goals; I adore these characters.  So much care went into the creation of these characters and it shows. I’m not sure if anyone coming out of this movie would have anything less to say then the stories characters oozed with personality. You truly get a sense of who they are as people; their agendas, goals, dreams, all are explored nicely. I’ve always liked a story where the apparent villains come to the aid of the protagonists, you get that in Castle in the Sky with the Dola Gang. These Airship pirates initially come off as antagonists with a dastardly agenda. However through their goofy fumbles and silly failed attempts to capture Sheeta and steal away her crystal, you find yourself growing fond of this group of bumbling pirates. So, when it finally comes time for Pazu to reluctantly ask for their help to rescue his friend from the true evil of the story, these “Bad guys” you were secretly rooting for join the battle for good and it’s very satisfying to see what comes next. The Dola Gang helps to flesh out Pazu and Sheeta and also add a nice levity to the story. All of these characters are the vessels that carried this story and made it truly mesmerizing.
